ðŸš€ First Practical Work in FreeCodeCamp
Welcome to my first FreeCodeCamp practical project! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my first hands-on experience with HTML & CSS, where I experimented with form elements like radio buttons, checkboxes, and proper structuring.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s inside?

A simple yet functional form with improved styling
Radio buttons grouped correctly for proper selection
A clean and structured HTML layout
ðŸ“Œ Goals of this project:

Learn how forms work in HTML
Understand how to use radio and checkbox inputs
Practice proper grouping and structuring of form elements
ðŸ’¡ Follow along as I continue improving my web development skills! ðŸš€
